# Highest Common Factor Calculator

This program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of a set of integers entered by the user.

## Features

- Calculate the highest common factor of a set of integers.
- Validate user input to ensure only integers are entered and the number of integers is not zero.

## Dependencies

- **JUnit 5:** For unit testing.
- **Jackson Core:** For JSON processing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Make sure you have the required dependencies configured in your project.
4. Run the `Main` class.
5. Follow the instructions to enter the number of integers and the integers themselves.
6. The program will display the highest common factor of the entered integers.

## File Structure

- `src/main/java`: Contains the main Java source files.
- `src/test/java`: Contains the unit test files.
- `addresses.json`: Sample JSON file containing address data.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Command-line interface (CLI) or integrated development environment (IDE) to run the Java program.

## Usage Example
$ java Main
Enter the number of integers:
5
Enter the integers:
20
0
5
78
60
The highest common factor is: 1
